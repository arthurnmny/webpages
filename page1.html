    <p>The rain fell steadily on the roof of Forks High School as Bella stared out the cafeteria window.</p>
    <p>Edward had been gone for three days, and she knew something was wrong.</p>
    <p>Alice appeared at her table, her golden eyes filled with concern.</p>
    <p>"Bella, we need to talk," she whispered urgently.</p>
    <p>"It's about Edward. He's gone to confront the Volturi alone."</p>
    <p>Bella's heart stopped. "What? Why didn't anyone tell me?"</p>
    <p>"He didn't want you involved. He thought he was protecting you."</p>
    <p>Without thinking, Bella grabbed her jacket and rushed toward the parking lot.</p>
    <p>Alice followed, moving with inhuman speed to catch up.</p>
    <p>"I'm coming with you," Bella declared, her voice shaking but determined.</p>
    <p>"We leave tonight," Alice agreed, pulling out her phone to make arrangements.</p>
    <p>As the sun set over the cloudy Washington sky, Bella packed a small bag.</p>
    <p>She left a note for Charlie, claiming a spontaneous trip to visit her mother.</p>
    <p>The Cullens' house was alive with activity when she arrived.</p>
    <p>Carlisle stood in the center, coordinating their plan with military precision.</p>
    <p>"Italy is dangerous for us right now," he warned. "The Volturi won't take kindly to interference."</p>
    <p>"I don't care," Bella said firmly. "Edward would do the same for any of us."</p>
    <p>Rosalie looked skeptical but said nothing, while Emmett grinned with anticipation.</p>
    <p>As they prepared to leave, Bella felt the weight of what lay ahead.</p>
    <p>But nothing would stop her from saving the vampire she loved.</p>
